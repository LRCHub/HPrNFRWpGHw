[00:02.16] Yeah, brraaa
[00:06.09] Yeah
[00:08.09] 
[00:08.40] Hey, what are you hiding? (watch)
[00:10.48] What you do when you're gone? (hey, hey)
[00:12.31] Nothing wrong being private (watch)
[00:14.13] Make sure it ain't wrong (yeah)
[00:16.22] Your life double-sided (watch)
[00:18.31] Two-faced like coins
[00:20.18] What side do I get? (watch)
[00:22.20] What side are you on?
[00:32.70] 
[00:23.35] So, what have you done? (brra)
[00:26.46] Some of your dirt has come to light (yeah, why were you?)
[00:30.16] Speedin' up that hill until the brakes come off (yeah, hey)
[00:34.26] And someone saw you in a fight
[00:37.39] Am I right?
[00:42.89] 
[00:41.13] It doesn't matter to you if you get heads or tails
[00:46.02] You just don't like the flip all thе time
[00:49.13] But if you spin it, then you get to see both sidеs
[00:53.38] Oh, the thrill of the double life
[01:09.88] 
[00:57.23] Lie detector time (watch)
[01:00.30] Do you feel bad when you lie? (watch)
[01:04.13] The look on your face says the best life (watch)
[01:08.04] And then come home like it's fine
[01:11.28] Am I right? (watch)
[01:20.78] 
[01:13.28] So, what have you done?
[01:16.36] Some of your dirt has come to light (why were you?)
[01:20.39] Speedin' up that hill until the brakes come off (hey)
[01:24.23] And someone saw you in a fight
[01:27.48] Am I right? (ah)
[01:35.48] 
[01:31.36] It doesn't matter to you if you get heads or tails
[01:35.85] You just don't like the flip all the time
[01:39.24] But if you spin it, then you get to see both sides
[01:43.46] Oh, the thrill of the double life (brraaa)
[02:04.46] 
[01:46.14] Who will you be tonight?
[01:48.11] That's the question (brraaa)
[01:50.06] Who will Gru be tonight?
[01:52.17] That's the question
[02:01.67] 
[01:57.91] I know you heard the rumors (hey)
[01:59.68] You must get over to it right away (oh)
[02:05.95] If anyone can do it, you gotta get there soon, it's not okay (hey)
[02:11.71] You got cars to drive, plenty jets to fly (blah, blah)
[02:15.44] When will you arrive? You're running out of time
[02:19.31] Don't you see that everything is on the line?
[02:23.28] So I'm sorry, but you have to choose a side
[02:44.78] 
[02:27.20] You'll never know when it's your time to go (side, hey)
[02:31.39] And where you end up in life, that's cold (side)
[02:35.90] You can't ignore, you're spending your life (blah, blah, side)
[02:39.22] Your watch is broken 'cause you spent all your time (side)
[02:43.14] It's now or never unless everything rights (side)
[02:47.39] Before the spinning stops, you must pick a side (hey-hey, brraaa)
[03:19.89] 
[02:53.86] Who will you be tonight?
[02:56.25] That's the question (yeah, yeah)
[02:58.01] Who will Gru be tonight?
[03:00.19] That's the question
[03:01.92] Who will you be tonight? (hey)
[03:04.28] That's the question (hey)
[03:06.25] Who will Gru be tonight? (ayy)
[03:08.32] That's the question
